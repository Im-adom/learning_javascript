1.	Write a program that determines whether a given number is positive or negative.
Answer:
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));

if (number < 0){
    console.log("This is a negative number.")
}
else if (number > 0){
    console.log("This is a positive number.")
}
else {
    console.log("The number is zero.")
}
2.	Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));

if (number % 2 == 0){
    console.log("This is an even number.")
}
else {
    console.log("This is an odd number.")
}
3.	Write a program to determine the greater of two numbers.
const number1 = parseInt(prompt("Enter a first number:"));
const number2 = parseInt(prompt("Enter a second number:"));

if (number1 > number2){
    console.log(`${number1} is greater than ${number2}`)
}
else {
    console.log(`${number2} is greater than ${number1}`)
}
4.	Write a program that transforms a numerical grade to a letter grade (e.g grade 10 should display “A”).
const mark = parseInt(prompt("Enter your mark:"));

if (mark >= 80 && mark <= 100){
    console.log("Your mark is a grade A")
}
else if (mark >= 60 && mark <= 79){
    console.log("Your mark is a grade B")
}
else if (mark >= 50 && mark <= 69){
    console.log("Your mark is a grade C")
}
else if (mark >= 40 && mark <= 59){
    console.log("Your mark is a grade D")
}
else if (mark >= 30 && mark <= 49){
    console.log("Your mark is a grade E")
}
else {
    console.log("You had an F. You failed!")
}
5.	Write a program that calculates the ticket price based on age with the following conditions: age below 12 pay a ticket price of 5, age below 18 pay a ticket price of 10, age below 60 pay a ticket price of 20, age over 60 play a ticket price of 15.
const age = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"));

if (age >= 0 && age < 12){
    console.log("Your ticket price is 5")
}
else if (age >= 12 && age < 18){
    console.log("Your ticket price is 10")
}
else if (age >= 18 && age < 60){
    console.log("Your ticket price is 20")
}

else {
    console.log("Your ticket price is 15")
}
6.	Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year.

const year = parseInt(prompt("Enter year:"));

if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0)){
    console.log("It is a leap year")
}
else {
    console.log("It is a normal year.")
}

7.	Write a program that calculates a discount based on the purchase amount. Prices equal or over 100 discount have a discount of 20. Prices equal or over 50 have a discount of 10. Otherwise discount is 0
const price = parseInt(prompt("Enter the price of your product: "));

if (price >= 100){
    console.log("You have a discount of 20")
}
else if (price >= 50){
    console.log("You have a discount of 10.")
}
else{
    console.log("You have no discount. Sorry.")
}
8.	Write a program that greets the user based on the time of day. Display good morning, good afternoon or good evening based on the time of day when you run the code.
const currentTime = parseInt(prompt("What says your time?(in 24 hour format: "));


if (currentTime >= 6 && currentTime < 12){
    console.log("Good morning!")
}
else if (currentTime >= 12 && currentTime < 18){
    console.log("Good afternoon!")
}
else {
    console.log("Good evening!")
}
9.	Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes it. The formula for BMI is: weight / (height * height).
const weight = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your weight (kg): "));
const height = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your height (m): "));

const bmi = weight / (height * height);
console.log(`Your BMI is ${bmi}`);

if (bmi < 18.5) {
    console.log("Underweight");
} else if (bmi >= 18.5 && bmi < 25) {
    console.log("Normal weight");
} else if (bmi >= 25 && bmi < 30) {
    console.log("Overweight");
} else {
    console.log("Obese");
}
10.	Write a simple number guessing game. Provide a secret number and a guess. Based on those numbers give players clues if their guess is higher, lower or correct.
